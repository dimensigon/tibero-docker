### Description

Tibero Database is a RDBMS database that has a worldwide growing position as well in Europe. In Asia and especially in South Korea where it has a dominant market share. It has been promoted by the South Korean Government to get a safer data engine against cyberattacks and to be technology independent.

Tibero was built for compatibility with Oracle Database and IBM DB2 Database at the same time. PSM is a built-in language that shares package names with PL/SQL.

Oracle DBAs and DB Developers find Tibero interesting because it shares administration concepts and enable developers to port their code without changes in 97% of the cases. Companies that adopt Tibero pursue to keep 1 code branch that works in 2 different engines at the same time, Oracle and Tibero.

Tibero simplifies the terms of licensing and it is often used as a Cloud Strategy because of the wide number of features available with different cloud providers and the added-value it brings to the applications.

Tibero Database is a proven RDBMS that stands versus Oracle Database or Exadata in terms of performance, scalability, flexibility and security at competitive cost versus Open-Source commercial Ecosystem vendors.
